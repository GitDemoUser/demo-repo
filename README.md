This repository contains a demo project that will be used for Git training, and demonstration of DVCS concepts.

Git branching:
	allows fast and cheap context switching
	the working copy is always the same
Merging branches is almost trivial in Git except when it comes to conflicts.
Merging conflicts is usually best done manually for a small number of conflicts. There are tools to automate merging conflicts but it is again better to do them so manually.

Testing fast-forward merge versus true merge.
